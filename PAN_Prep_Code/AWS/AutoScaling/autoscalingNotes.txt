What Is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?:
- tool used to scale resources up or down depending on traffic or user needs
- AutoScaling components:
	1. Groups: EC2 instances are organized into groups so that they can be treated as a logical unit for the purpose of scaling and management
	2. Launch Configurations: group uses launch configurations as a template for its EC2 instances
		* When you create a launch configuration, you can specify information such as the AMI ID, instance type, key pair, security groups, and block device mapping for your instances
		* cannot update launch configurations, can only copy it, modify it and then subplement the new launch configuration for the old one
	3. Scaling Plans: tells auto scaling when and how to scale


Updating Launch Configurations with AWS CLI:
1. Describe the current launch configuration using the describe-launch-configurations command
2. Create a new launch configuration using the create-launch-configuration command
3. Update the launch configuration for the Auto Scaling group using the update-auto-scaling-group command with the --launch-configuration-names parameter


Auto Scaling Groups:
- contains a collection of EC2 instances that share similar characteristics and are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of instance scaling and management
- starts by launching enough EC2 instances to meet its desired capacity
	* Auto Scaling group maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group
	* If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it
